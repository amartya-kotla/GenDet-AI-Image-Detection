Implemented the GenDet model, an adversarial teacher-student transformer network designed for detecting AI-generated images. Research Paper found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08880)

Coded the transformer encoder block, self attention mechanism, teacher student architecture and custom loss functions from scratch.
