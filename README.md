Implemented the GenDet model, an adversarial teacher-student transformer network designed for detecting AI-generated images. Research Paper found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08880).
Coded the transformer encoder block, self attention mechanism, teacher student architecture and custom loss functions from scratch.
Achieved good accuracy at nearly 90% using real and AI generated images from the following datasets: [AI and Human Art Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kausthubkannan/ai-and-human-art-classification), [AI recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/superpotato9/dalle-recognition-dataset) from Kaggle.
